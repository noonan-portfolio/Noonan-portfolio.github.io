## What I Bring to the Table
Employers value people who can **work independently**, communicate clearly, and deliver results - qualities I've focused on building:

- **Self-motivated:** I take ownership of tasks and see them through without constant oversight.
- **Tech and Tools:** Comfortable with Github, project management tools(Trello/Asana), and collaboration platfroms (Slack, Zoom, Google Workspace).
- **Communication:** Clear written and verbal communication, which I know us essential in remote or hybrid teams.
- **Problem-soliving mindset:** I enjoy breaking problems down and finding practical solutions.

One of my long-term goals is to **work remotely, or at least transition into a role that allows remote work**.

Remote work appeals to me because:
- It allows deeper focus and productivity.
- It gives flexibility to balance professional and personal growth.
- It encourages strong written communication and async collaboration - both areas I'm continually improving.


In the meantime, I'm excited to keep building my skills, growing as a professional, and adding value to every team I join.
